# Test Case

## Test Plans
## Input
*  How : Our Implementation for this step requires multiple steps :
*  Step 1 : Find a distance value between each pqir of snesors. To test the distance value, we may use the number we see 
for the height and length, as well as  as the Pythagorean Theorem.
* Step 2 : Check the angle found between each pair of sensors using the distance value initally found.
* step 3 : Using the values, the angle should approximately to be detect different types of obstacles
* step 4 : Detect the obstacles

## output :
* As we had steps for each test, we will amke steps
* step 1 : comapre the outputted value for the hypotenuase to the value
* step 2 : using the same technique as step 1 except calculating the angle
* step 3 : Adding audio to the buzz sensirs
